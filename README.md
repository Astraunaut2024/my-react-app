# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Agri-Invest Project

## Project Overview

The Agri-Invest project is a React-based web application designed to support agricultural investment. The project aims to provide a platform where investors can connect with agricultural initiatives, track progress, and make informed investment decisions.

## Features

* User-friendly interface to explore agricultural investment opportunities.
* Investment tracking and management.
* Real-time updates on project performance.
* Data visualization for investment statistics.
* Secure and reliable data management.

## Technologies Used

* **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
* **Chakra UI**: For responsive and accessible UI components.
* **FastAPI**: Backend API for handling data and business logic.
* **Python**: Backend processing and data management.
* **Database**: Relational/NoSQL database for storing project and investment data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agri-invest.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd agri-invest
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
